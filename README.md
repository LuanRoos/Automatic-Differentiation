# Automatic-Differentiation

My attempt at an automatic differentiation library to be used for calculating gradients of a feedforward neural network.

To compile, just run the bash script make.sh. An executable will be created called runExamples.out. Run this to get a quick taste of what the little library does.

Have fun!
